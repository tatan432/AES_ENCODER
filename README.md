# AES_ENCODER
The part of work is related to 128-bit AES encryption algorithm RTL design.  There are three parts to the design-
1. SISO : Single Input and Single output
2. MIMO : Multiple input Multiple output
3. N_CHANNEL : N Channel serial input and N channel serial output

RTL is written in verilog, where as the testbench is written in system verilog. The part of the test bench is written by Saurabh Jain(User: @srbhjn459)
